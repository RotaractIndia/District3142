Artists, students, friends, and family alike came down to paint the sections of the wall, all under the theme “Climate Change.” The intent of this project was mainly to brand RCTNE as the creme de la creme of the Rotaract District 3142. We also wished to spread awareness about climate change through art and individuality. Seeing the wall with its vibrant colors and strong messages was a great feeling because we knew we made it count!

Right from brainstorming on ideas, avenue understanding, and picking out the right candidate. This project had it all. This initiative was divided into 3 phases. In Phase 1, applicants were divided into a team of 5 and each team had to pitch a project idea, work on the groundwork and manage the overall execution of that project. In all total 19 teams had applied and 8 shortlisted projects were executed thereby giving the GBMs an opportunity to take charge of things. In Phase 2, orientation was conducted of all the GBMs and new members, where they were taught about all the avenues, their roles, and responsibilities. In Phase 3, the new members had applied for a core position for the upcoming year and they went through a rigorous screening process, right from group discussion, aptitude test, real-time understanding, Rotaract knowledge to drilling in the interview by an experienced panel. Saksham itself is a brilliant HRD concept thereby bringing the best out of your members and sustain the legacy."},{proj:"Work (IT) from Home",club:"Rotaract Club of Thane North End",content:"The aim of the project was to involve members to showcase their talents from home and provide tutorials to viewers; a fun and creative way to educate and encourage people to learn new skills. Sometimes, we don’t know people around us possess such a unique skill but many times we don’t know about our own hidden skills and its very important to keep trying new things. Under this project, we had asked all the participants to send a video showcasing their talent and give a quick tutorial for the audience to learn a new skill each day. The members came up with amazing videos showcasing their talents with a diverse mix of tutorials. The team put together 52 acts in honor of Council 52. The club members also contributed by making one video together - 52 of us singing “I want it that way” by Backstreet Boys to involve everyone from the club. This project was special because when everybody was low thinking they would be unable to enjoy the Rotaract spirit because of the pandemic, RCTNE chose to truly make it count."},{proj:"Poetica",club:"Rotaract Club of Navi Mumbai Smart City",content:"Poetry is a beautiful art and there are only a few gifted with the ability to write them.
