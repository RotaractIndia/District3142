                            A bunch of young enthusiastic alike minds who aspire to become a better version of
                            themselves. And we were just like you, yes you, the reader. We were either confused with our
                            lives or didn’t have a proper goal setting and at times used to wonder what exactly we are
                            passionate about. AND THEN WE JOINED ROTARACT.
                            Today we’re less confused, have more clarity of things in life, and know what exactly we’re
                            passionate about. And on top of this, we’ve got this great Rotaract Family, that stays abide
                            by all the thinnest and the thickest things that hit our lives, motivates us to do more, and
                            together we're on the verge of becoming a better version of ourselves day by day. <br/><br/>

                            give you goosebumps, we feel those goosebumps during every Daptar
                            session. Daptar - the name resembles a school bag but the project
                            focuses on teaching life skills that are quite often missing from
                            a school bag. Under Daptar, we select ambassadors from the entire
                            district who are interested and have the skill set required to
                            teach students. The ambassadors are trained by professionals. From
                            public speaking, effective communication, interpersonal skills to
                            value for money, good touch bad touch, personal and environmental
                            hygiene, the ambassadors are trained for every single thing under
                            the sky that is necessary to survive in the real world. These
                            ambassadors then visit the schools that have been taken under
                            Rotaract District 3142 every week and impart these learnings to
                            the students in form of activities and indirect learning methods.
                            Daptar indeed is a bag full of emotions, you get to witness
                            emotional hormones skyrocketing by the end of one academic year(Oh
                            Gosh those tears').

                            across the entire district on the 1st of July. Why on 1st July?
                            Why not anytime else? Well, we promote having a regular blood
                            donation camp but July 1st is when the new Rotaract year starts
                            and there’s no better deed than serving the community. Over the
                            years, we’ve developed a brand of our own where donors along with
                            the rotaractors eagerly wait for these camps to take place. This
                            time we had Lokmat as our media partner and with the growing
                            awareness campaigns across the globe, we anticipate collaborating
                            with more brands in the years to come where we come together
                            unanimously and promote the noble cause of donating blood.

                            guilt of not working toward the short term goals you had set for
                            yourself which will eventually push the timeline of your long term

                            person was the speaker of a session you had attended a year ago
                            organized by Rotaract District 3142. That person had a similar
                            story like yours but the only thing that they had an edge over you
                            were they kept asking themselves "WHAT’S NEXT?" They asked it when
                            they had a fall, they asked it when they reached a milestone, they
                            asked it when things went south and north and center and all
                            across. And BANG… you get that little dose of motivation required
                            enough to keep you going. That’s NEXT - The Conclave for you, a
                            motivational session where speakers from different walks of life
                            come together at a single platform, share their stories with the
                            attendees and inspire them to achieve all their dreams. The
                            initiative had great success where various celebrity speakers like
                            Prajakta Koli, Abhi-Niyu, Akshay Laxman, Sunil Jadhav, and many
                            more have inspired the audiences with their stories.

                            Voila! Here is the place for you to invest it.<br>
                            Rotaract Entertainment Destination, which is popularly known as RED is one such place where
                            you would find entertainment and talent in abundance. It’s a reason for our rotaractors to
                            unite, to expand their creative thinking, to compete, to learn and to provide the impetus to
                            carry on with their rotaraction. RED is a 2 days long cultural extravaganza, which conducts
                            events that cater to art forms like Literary, Fine and Performing. The scale at which the
                            event is conducted is colossal, with a footfall of more than 1200 people. We have had
                            personalities like Shraddha Musale , Mayur Sakhare, Hritu Zee, Mihika Sansare and Sushmita
                            Singh associate with RED as our dignified judges in the past. Brands like Motul, YES
                            Foundation, Saraswat Bank, Brupp- The Craft Beer Café and Future Tayari have enjoyed
                            deliverables during the previous years at RED.
                            RED! RED! IT’S ALL ABOUT RED!<br>
                            RED is an emotion for Rotaract District 3142 and we take extreme pride in taking it up a
                            notch every passing year.

                            RISE – Rotaract Initiative towards Sporting Excellence, is the annual Sports initiative
                            organized by Rotaract District 3142. It is a platform where Rotaractors get an opportunity
                            to showcase their zeal, enthusiasm and talent across various sporting events like Tennis,
                            Kho Kho, Kabaddi, Carrom, Chess, Football, Cricket, Badminton and much more.
                            <br/>
                            The main objective of the event is to promote a sense of team-spirit and
                            competitiveness amongst our Rotaractors and support infrastructure,
                            education and other vital necessities of underprivileged schools across
                            our District. More than 3000 Rotaractors come together and create an atmosphere full of
                            motivation and competitive spirit, which further enhances the event and creates long lasting
                            memories.
